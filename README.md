# Face Classification and OCR
Applies various combinations of classifiers (SVM, CNN, Decision Tree) to extracted features (LBP, HOG) of individual faces.


### Summary 
This projectâ€™s goal was to train a face detection and recognition program in group and individual multimedia. To accomplish this, faces and number cards were detected using cascade classifiers. Once regions-of-interest were identified, various classifiers attempted to estimate class membership using a variety of derived features. The best performing face classifier was the Convolutional Neural Network with AlexNet configuration with an accuracy of 95.6%, whereas the algorithmic implementation of OCR shown an accuracy of 87% on images and 99% on videos.
